# Horse or Human Classifier

Welcome to the Horse or Human Classifier project! This repository contains code for a deep learning model that classifies whether a given image depicts a horse or a human.

##Overview

For this assignment, I tried my best to get a decent accuracy without using a pre-trained model. 

# Accuracy

The highest accuracy achieved was 88% without using a pre-trained model.

# To be improved

Working on further projects, i learned more about computer vision, i believe with more effort put in, i can get an even better accuracy.
